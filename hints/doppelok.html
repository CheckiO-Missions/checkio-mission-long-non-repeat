    <div class="answer">
        <p>The idea of the mission is that you need to go through the line (as many times as needed) and find all possible combinations of unique symbols. They can start even from the middle of the line, or for example in the line "trgrhsoij" the first combination will be "trg", because after "g" there is another "r", but if we discard the first "r", then we will get a much larger combination. grhsoij".</p>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>Let's start by understanding the order of our code. The first thing we'll do is add two list variables. The first "result", it will store unique combinations of symbols. The second "new", it will store the intermediate result of unique combinations. Next, we will add a while loop in which we will go through our string until we find all unique combinations.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = []
new = []
while line:
    # do something

        I don't know what to do anymore. I need a little hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Next, we will add a for loop, in which we will go through the line. Inside this cycle, you need to check whether the letter has already been found in the combination or not and perform the appropriate actions.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
result = []
new = []
while line:
    for i in line:
        if i not in new:
            # do something
        else:
            # do something

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Okay, you need to add some actions to our if conditions. In the first condition of checking for the inclusion of a letter in the list, if there is no such letter - we will add the letter to the list, if such a letter already existed, we will combine the "new" list into a string, add it to the "result", again define "new" as a new list, and let's add to it the letter on which we stopped and go further by analogy.</p>

result = []

        if i not in new:
            new.append(i)

            result.append(''.join(new))
            new = []
            new.append(i)

        Please help! We have almost solved this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>It remains for us to logically complete the while loop. So after we've for looped through the string, we'll add the last unique string fragment to result, redefine "new" as a new list, and shift our input string forward by 1 element. This is to search for new unique fragments in a string. And so on until the line is empty.</p>

        <p>All you have to do is wrap the code in a function expression and return the longest unique string from the result list using the max() function. We specify the len() function as the key argument, and "" as the default argument to return an empty line if line is also empty.</p>

        A great example of using a generator function. Instead of return, we use yield, with its help we generate the generator object immediately in the max() function every time.</p>
